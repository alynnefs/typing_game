When playing, the game will then ask the user to type a sentence exactly. The program Will then return the amount of time taken, the WPM (Words Per Minute) of the player, and the percent accurracy of the players sentence compared to the original. 

There is also a high scores list that keeps track of all the scores entered. When viewing in the game, it will automatically sort by WPM and return back to the user in a nicely formatted table.

How to Play:
Just follow the in-game directions! The Letter at the beginning of each menu key indicates what button to press for that choice.
Have fun!
